# Song Suggestion Depends on Weather 🎵🌦️


It uses API (such as Weather-Stack, Youtube, Telegram) to retrieve the current weather conditions for that location. Based on the weather conditions, the program selects a song from a pre-defined list of songs that are appropriate for that weather. The program outputs the name and artist and Also link of the selected song as a suggestion to the user via Telegram Bot.
